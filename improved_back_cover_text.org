# Option 1: Justified with Better Settings
A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda gifted the world with Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, the most widely read translation in the West. Yet, after his departure in 1977, this masterpiece was systematically reshaped. When "The Blessed Lord" is replaced 245 times with "The Supreme Personality of Godhead", it's not a mere word shift; it transforms the entire relationship one forms with the divine. One version inspires mystics who long for divine love; the other molds followers bound to institutional doctrine. The systematic transformation cannot be denied. The question is not whether it happened—it's which version is shaping your consciousness right now.

# Option 3: Rewritten for Better Flow
A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda gave the world his Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, the West's most beloved translation. After his passing in 1977, this spiritual masterpiece underwent systematic revision. The replacement of "The Blessed Lord" with "The Supreme Personality of Godhead" in 245 places does more than change words—it transforms how readers relate to the divine. One text creates mystics seeking divine love; the other produces followers of institutional doctrine. The evidence is undeniable. The only question: which version shapes your spiritual life today?
