A guide to key terms and concepts for understanding the transformation of sacred texts.

**Bhagavad-gītā** — "Song of God"; 700-verse Sanskrit scripture recording Krishna's teachings to Arjuna on a battlefield. The text at the center of this investigation.

**BBT** — Bhaktivedanta Book Trust; publishing house established by Prabhupāda to preserve and distribute his books. After 1977, became the institution that authorized the controversial revisions.

**"Blessed Lord" vs "Supreme Personality of Godhead"** — The most systematic change in the revision: 245 instances where intimate divine address became institutional theological title. Dr. Chen's research shows this creates different neural pathways in readers.

**Consciousness Programming** — How repeated exposure to specific language patterns literally rewires the brain. Devotional language activates emotional centers; theological language activates analytical regions.

**Editorial Authority** — The question at the heart of this book: Who has the right to change a spiritual master's words after his death? The editors believed they inherited this authority; many readers disagree.

**ISKCON** — International Society for Krishna Consciousness; the global spiritual movement Prabhupāda founded. The revision controversy has divided this community for forty years.

**Jayadvaita Swami** — Lead editor of the 1983 revision. A sincere disciple who believed he was serving his guru by "perfecting" the texts using original manuscripts.

**Krishna** — Speaker of the Bhagavad-gītā; the Supreme Divine who reveals spiritual knowledge to his friend Arjuna. How Krishna is presented—as intimate friend or distant theology—shapes reader experience.

**Maya Rodriguez** — The everywoman narrator of this investigation; represents millions of readers who discovered by accident that their sacred text had been transformed.

**Neuroscience Evidence** — Dr. Sarah Chen's Stanford research proving that different translations create measurably different types of spiritual practitioners through distinct neural development.

**Original (1972) Edition** — The Bhagavad-gītā As It Is that Prabhupāda personally approved and used for teaching from 1972-1977. Emphasizes accessible devotion and personal divine relationship.

**Prabhupāda** — A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami (1896-1977); the spiritual master who brought Krishna consciousness to the West. His final instruction: "Don't change" his books.

**Revised (1983) Edition** — The posthumously edited version with 541 of 700 verses altered. Emphasizes theological precision and systematic understanding.

**Sacred Text Transparency** — The simple solution proposed: clearly label different versions so readers can choose consciously. Model: Bible translations (KJV, NIV, etc.) are distinguished, not hidden.

**Secretarial Errors** — The editors' justification for changes: early typists misheard Prabhupāda's accent. Critics note that Prabhupāda approved the "errors" in hundreds of classes.

**77% Alteration** — The documented scope of changes: 541 verses out of 700 were modified without informing readers. This isn't copy editing but consciousness transformation.

**Two Paths** — What the investigation reveals: the original creates mystics through heart connection; the revision creates theologians through intellectual understanding. Both valid, but readers deserve to know which they're choosing.

**Underground Resistance** — Networks of devotees who preserved and distributed original editions when institutions tried to suppress them. Their work made this investigation possible.

**Version Comparison** — The key to discovery: when readers compare editions side-by-side, the transformation becomes undeniable. What institutions hid for forty years, the internet exposed.

*"The words can be returned through simple honesty."* — The book's central message that transparency solves what deception created.
